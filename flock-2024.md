  Konflux is an opinionated, Kubernetes-native, security first software factory based on Tekton.
]

Our goals are to be able to:

‚å¨ Build software that consists of **multiple components, from multiple repositories**.

üïµ Provide **transparency on the software supply chain**, including both what makes up the software and how it was built.

‚úÖ Help teams ensure their software **meets their own expectations** by providing functional integration test capabilities.

ü§ù Provide a way for software teams to **release to destinations under the control other teams** with guarantees that it **meets  the destination teams' expectations**.

üåà Tie all that together with a **unified user experience** across the entire build, test, and release process

If any of the following statements sound like you:

- ü•¥ You **don't have a secure build environment** today. ("Where do we even build?")

- üí∏ You want to secure your build pipeline, but **don't know how or don't have the time**.
 
- üíÄ You worry about the **provenance*** of your software builds.

- ‚õìÔ∏è The build system you have today is **inflexible or difficult** to extend.

- üòï You **get lost trying to follow the status** of artifacts on their way to release.

Then, Konflux might be the platform you.

As the Konflux build pipelines are engineered with security in mind:

- Builds produced by Konflux build-tasks are certain to have **accurate source bill of materials (SBOMs)**.
- Build dependencies are fetched up front and the build is executed with **no network available**.

As Konflux is based on Tekton:

- Everything that happened during the build is recorded in a **signed, immutable log called an attestation**.
- This lets us write **machine-readable policy** which can be used at release time to determine if an artifact is acceptable.

As Konflux gates builds at release-time:

- Platform users can **develop new build strategies** in their production workspace to speed proofs of concept.
- Users get continuous feedback during their development cycle on pull requests, so there's **no surprises when it comes to release time**.

As Konflux is an integration of open source projects:

- Konflux is flexible in its own architecture and permits **different deployment configurations**.

- Our API server is **the kube API server**. Services are [controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) that expose their API as Custom Resource Definitions.
- We **use tekton** for anything that should be extended by the user (building, testing, releasing). Expose as much detail via kube resources as possible. Prefer to implement native tasks to perform work on cluster, rather than calling out to third-party services.
- The **user has admin** in their workspace. This means that the user can access secrets in their workspace. This means that the system can never provide secrets to the user that are scoped beyond that user's domain. A user can exfiltrate the push secret from their workspace, build invalid content on their laptop, and push it to their buildtime registry. Such a build will be rejected at release time.
- Artifacts built, tested, and shipped by the system are **OCI artifacts**. SBOMs, attestations, signatures, and other supporting metadata are stored in the registry alongside the artifact, tagged by the `cosign triangulate` convention.
- While not true today, it should be possible to **install** one subsystem without the others and to replace one subsystem with a new one without affecting the others. See [!148](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/architecture/pull/148) for an example of attempting to achieve this.
- Any attestation used for making a release-time decision should be provably trusted (either because it is GPG signed or its immutable reference is added to the provenance by a trusted task).

.footnote[:bulb: Adding new functionality usually looks like either adding a new **controller** or adding a new **tekton task**.]
