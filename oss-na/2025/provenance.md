## When you buy something physical...

- 📍 Where was it assembled?
- 🏭 Where did its parts come from?
- 🌱 Did it meet blah organic criteria?
- 👩‍🔬 Which quality inspector assessed it?
- 📜 What certifications does it have?

You get this information **stamped on packaging** or **included in the box**.

## When you consume a software artifact in production...

.large[
Do you know its **provenance**?
]

- 🏗️ Where is this artifact from?
- ⚙️ How was it produced?
- 🧪 What checks ran against it?
- 👤 Who claims these facts?
- 🔒 Can you trust those claims?

We generally don't get this with software today.

## What is provenance?

For software artifacts (containers, packages, binaries):

- 📂 **Source**: What sources were provided to the build?
- 🔄 **Transformation**: What steps were applied before the build?
- 🏗️ **Build Process**: How was it built? Where? When?
- 🛡️ **Post-Build**: What happened to the artifact after that?
- ✅ **Verification**: What checks were performed?

.foonote[
Generally, **provenance** is the **origin** of something.

## Traditional Software Signing is Limited

```
gpg --verify artifact.tar.gz.sig artifact.tar.gz
```

✅ **Identity**: Who signed this?  
❓ **Context**: What were they claiming when they signed it?

.large[
A signature just means **"it's good"** 

But good **how**? Good **why**?

.large[
An attestation is an **"I solemnly swear..."** statement
]

- 👤 **Who**: Identity making the claim (signed)
- 🔐 **Verification**: Cryptographically verifiable
- 📦 **What**: The artifact being described
- 📝 **Statement**: The specific claim being made

Instead of just "it's signed" → **"here's exactly what happened"**

## Stuff you can do

### 📊 **Compliance & Auditing**  
- Prove security practices were followed
- Generate audit reports automatically

### 🔍 **Incident Response**
- Trace back to root cause
- Understand blast radius

### 🧬 **Evolve Posture**
- Block artifacts out of compliance

## Enabling Safe Innovation

.large[
**One way**: Make insecure things impossible
]

- 🐢 Innovation is slow
- 🤷 Change gatekeepers may not understand needs  
- 🏃‍♀️ Devs circumvent restrictions, defeating the purpose

.large[
**Another way**: Define what "good" looks like
]

- ✅ Clear requirements for release
- 🧪 Freedom to experiment in development
- 🚀 Fast feedback loop
- 👥 Democratize contributions
